Things to do:

* Make the JVM interface work.
* Quote control characters in ARFF files
* The time of all 0s is an invalid time- "0000-00-00 00:00:00"
* Make hashes properly calculated for NTFS files with reasonably-sized holes


These drives are really slow:

 /corp/images/nus/1028.aff
 /corp/images/nus/1041.aff
 /corp/images/nus/1043.aff


These generate XML errors:
