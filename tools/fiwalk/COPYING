Except as noted below, fiwalk source code is public domain.

1. On computers that do not have a functioning regex library, fiwalk is
linked with regex.c version 0.12 from the Free Software
Foundation. That version of regex is covered under the GPL. So if you
compile fiwalk on a machine that does not have regex, the fiwalk
executable is GPLed.

2. The base64.cpp and base64.h implementation is Copyright by the
Internet Software Consortium, with portions Copyright 1995 by
